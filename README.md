Greetings,

I'm Jeff Knaus, and I accidentally created the [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) repository four or so years ago. This repository was originally only intended to serve my personal hands-free computing needs, but has evolved into a true community effort with multiple maintainers. It's now the defacto starting point for those needing to use computers hands-free with Talon!  

I enjoy tinkering with other talon-related projects like [Clickless Mouse](https://github.com/knausj85/clickless_mouse) in my spare time too.
